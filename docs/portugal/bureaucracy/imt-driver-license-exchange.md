# Driver license exchange

To exchange a driver's licence to a Portuguese one you need to do it via the IMT.

## My experience

1. Go to the IMT office and take a number
2. Wait 2 hours
3. The person in the office then told me I need to fill in an online form first and do a doctor assessment.

## What I should have done

1. Fill in the form online to initiate the exchange process [https://www.cognitoforms.com/IMT6/TROCADET%C3%8DTULOSDECONDU%C3%87%C3%83OESTRANGEIROS30](https://www.cognitoforms.com/IMT6/TROCADET%C3%8DTULOSDECONDU%C3%87%C3%83OESTRANGEIROS30)
2. Go to a doctor's office and ask for an IMT assessment. The doctor does a basic eye test and asks if you have any medical issues.
3. The doctor office automatically sends the certificate to the IMT.
4. Make an appointment to go to IMT (don't just turn up). Use the Siga App [https://siga.marcacaodeatendimento.pt/](https://siga.marcacaodeatendimento.pt/)
5. Attend the appointment. When you arrive, go to the "take a number" machine and enter your appointment number, and it will print your ticket.
6. Provide ID (resident permit the best as it is a proof of everything) and provide the current driver's licence.
7. You will receive a paper licence which you can use in Portugal while waiting for your new licence.
8. Wait, wait, wait.
9. The old licence is sent back to the origin country and the origin country needs to confirm the details before Portugal will issue a new one.
10. You will receive an email when the licence is completed.
11. If the new licence does not arrive within 2 weeks, make another appointment at IMT (Siga App) and they can finalize the process in the office.
12. The licence should then arrive in 1 - 2 weeks in the mail.

## Duration

3 months - 1 year

The part that takes the longest is waiting for the old licence to be verified.
