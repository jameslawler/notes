# Tax - Register for online access

The Portugal tax office has a fairly good online portal where you can check the status of requests, submit things like tax returns, ask questions and get quick responses. This reduces the need to physically go to the tax office which can take a long time.

## Register

1. Go to the tax office portal website and click the "Regsitar-se" [link](https://www.acesso.gov.pt/unauthed/novoUtilizadorForm?partID=PFAP&path=/geral/dashboard)
2. Choose the "Registo NIF" option and enter your NIF.
3. Follow the process, and then a physical letter will be sent in the mail to the address that you provided when you setup your NIF.
4. When you receive the letter (2 - 3 weeks later) you can then continue the process and gain access to the portal.

## Duration

2 - 3 weeks

The slowest part is waiting for the letter to arrive. Once you receive a NIF it is a good idea to register as soon as possible and not right before you want to submit a tax return.
