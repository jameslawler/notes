# Going places

Depending on the duration / permanence of the journey you have two prepositions available. It is hard to decide when to use each one as the temporaryness and permanence of the journey is subjective.

## Preposition - a

The **a** preposition is used for temporary journeys.

- going to your house to pick up a book and then come back later can be considered temporary, but going to your house for the night and coming back to school tomorrow can be considered permanent.
- going on holiday to Spain for a week can be considered temporary, but going to Spain to live for 3 months can be considered permanent.

## Preposition - para

The **para** preposition is used for permanent journeys.

:::tip

I remember the difference because **a** is a short preposition (one letter) and **para** is a long preposition (4 letters). **a** = short journey and **para** = long journey.
